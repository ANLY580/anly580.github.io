## Project #2

This second project is is open-ended with some constraints. It should involve NLP in support of an empirical research question that is either a small, focused contribution or negative result (meaning, your hypothesis may not bear out). Please review the [proposal guidelines here](proposal.html).

Your project report has the following required elements:

- Student group members and which student is responsible for what parts?
- Motivation. What is the research question and why is it worth asking?
-Relevant scientific literature. What prior work does your proposal rely upon or sets the context for your question?
- Data (collection)
- Methods
- Procedure
- Results (including evaluation)
- Analysis
- References

Your report should be in the form of a Jupyter or R notebook. Some of required elements you drafted for your proposal. But you will update and include them in your final product, as well.

Your project report should be **reproducible**. There should be a file in your project, called **README**, in any format of your choosing. For example, README can be in plain text format, a Jupyter Notebook, or a Word-processor document.  This file should give the steps which will exactly reproduce the numbers, tables and figures in your report.

In addition to the README, commit into GitHub Classroom Jupyter/R notebooks to include external modules that you create. Your notebook serves as your project report, in addition to your code and generated results.

For your final poster, plan to give a short, oral presentation of your work that accompanies your physical poster.

Your goal for the poster is to engage and not impress.
- Summarize your data
- Describe your main analysis strategy
- Describe your main findings.
- Draw conclusions with care, citing evidence from your data, and from any relevant literature.

 You will receive anonymous feedback on your work from members of other teams. They will consider your work according to standards for conference posters (see [ReviewForm.pdf](https://georgetown.instructure.com/courses/81464/files/2788879/download?wrap=1)). The feedback does not count in any part of your grade, but is a means by which your peers can anonymously share their thoughts about your work.
