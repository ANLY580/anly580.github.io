title: "Project 2 Proposal"
layout: page
---
This second project is open-ended with some constraints. It should involve NLP in support of an empirical research question that is either a small, focused contribution or negative result (meaning, your hypothesis may not bear out). Groups are again 1-4 and each group should submit their proposal in Canvas for approval.

The proposal should be about two pages and include the following components:

- **Student group members.**
- **Motivation.** What is the research question and why is it worth asking?
- **Relevant scientific literature.** What prior work does your proposal rely upon or sets the context for your question? It's okay to build off someone else's work or even implement something described. But you should be adding to this work by analyzing different data and also
- **Data.** Point to some (at least initial) data that exists and any further collection needed.
- **Plan.** Sketch out your plan.
- **Expected results.** It's absolutely fine if your work does not work as expected. But do include what you hope to accomplish.

Keep in mind that your **final report** has additional required elements:

- Which student was responsible for what parts?
- Data (collection details, if a part of your project)
- Methods
- Procedure
- Results (including evaluation)
- Analysis
- References

Finally:
- Plan to commit to GitHub Classroom your Jupyter/R notebooks (report) to include supportive code or libraries. Please make sure your code includes version requirements and any instructions necessary for running.
- Plan to give a short, oral presentation of your work with your poster. You will receive anonymous feedback on your work from members of other teams. They will consider your work according to standards for conference posters to include clarity, relevance, originality, substance, and evaluation. We'll provide further guidance on posters as we get close to the end of semester.
