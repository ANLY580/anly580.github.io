## Course Description

How do data scientists use tools and methods from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to process language data in order to derive insights? This course examines practical problems in content analysis using state-of-the-art NLP tools emphasizing when and how such tools are used. Topics include keyword extraction, computing similarity, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and dialogue. Tools and methods span from simple tools students build themselves to recent neural toolkits. Students will apply and extend existing software tools to text-processing tasks. Throughout, the course focuses on empirical thinking and analytical processes. A guiding principle in this class is that NLP as an applied practice does not end at deriving results, but in communicating findings to end users.
