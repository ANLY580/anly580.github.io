# 1 - Summary Notes and References

This summary includes external references from the associated Jupyter notebook (and duplicate lecture markdown) and aggregated here to make review easier. It's also a catch-all for anything I might mention in class or think is worthy of mention.

# Course Philosophy

You are in graduate school. Congratulations! You have moved from rote or structured learning to discovery or inquiry based learning. The professor's role is more as coach in this process -- and to large extent, what (and how much) you learn is now under your control. We will provide opportunity and path, and the rest is up to you. There are in-class quizzes to provide motivation and aid with assessment, but they are open book and not intended to stump you. Where exercises are indicated (both thoughtful or hands-on), take the time walk through them or you will come away from the class with only passing knowledge in NLP.

# Thought Exercises

1. How many words do you think there are in English? If you are not a native English speaker, what about your own native language? To estimate this, we'll come back to this topic in a couple of weeks.
2. About how many languages exist worldwide? (Hint: check Ethnologue below)
3. What do you think "ambiguous" means? Is it the same thing as being "vague"?

# Topical Notes
* What is NLP?
	* It's an inter-disciplinary topic in Artificial Intelligence that intersects with linguistics. It's hard because language is an AI-complete problem (it requires first solving general AI).
	* Predominant methods are machine learning-based to include statistical and neural models. When less data is available, knowledge-based methods may be more useful.
	* The representation of language is studied by linguists.
	* But social scientists and humanities scholars also focus on cultural and social aspects of language use.
What is computational linguistics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Linguistics)[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-linguistics/]
> "Human knowledge is expressed in language. So computational linguistics is very important." -   Mark Steedman, ACL Presidential Address (2007)
* How is computational linguistics different from natural language processing? [Great answer from Jason Eisner on Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-is-computational-linguistics-different-from-natural-language-processing). [Eisner](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/) was [interviewed recently on NLP Pedagogy](https://link.medium.com/aWIqbiFSxY).
* Why are data scientists so recently excited by NLP? Until the last few years, one needed special knowledge (e.g., a computational linguist) to compute over language. With the explosion of Deep Learning and Application Programming Interfaces, less specialized knowledge is now required. In some sense, language

### Keeping up with NLP Research

* Semantic Scholar (Allen Research) provides a useful interface that shows you related papers to those you have searched. For example, here's a search on [multiword expressions](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Multiword-Expressions%3A-A-Pain-in-the-Neck-for-NLP-Sag-Baldwin/0c3cb9f183932e268002a3acaee12419dd979614).

* [arXiv.org] from Cornell University has a [daily subscription](https://arxiv.org/help/subscribe) based on your topic of interest. There's so much emergent research... good luck trying to keep up!

* [Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com) focuses on free and open resources relating to machine learning topics.

* Keep an eye on [Sebastian Ruder's Tracking Progress in NLP](https://github.com/sebastianruder/NLP-progress)

### Conferences
The first two conferences (ACL, NAACL) are highly recommended and now have a broader audience than computational linguists. Other attendance include machine learning experts and NLP practitioners. This year NAACL had about 1600 participants and is about 3x larger than years past when limited to computational linguists.

The second two conferences (EMNLP, COLING) are more linguistics-oriented. Regardless, audiences change over the years and it’s worth keeping an eye out here, as well.
