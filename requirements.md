## Requirements

This page is for convenience only. Please see official requirements and rubrics on [Canvas](https://georgetown.instructure.com).

The emphasis for grading is on practical exercises and communicating results. There are two larger assignments that involve R or Python programming. These may be done in groups of 1-4. Assignments will be submitted via GitHub classroom. Open book quizzes in class are focused on concepts from the reading, but may also be used to drive discussion.
