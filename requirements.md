This page is for convenience only. Please see official requirements and rubrics on [Canvas](https://georgetown.instructure.com).

The emphasis for grading is on practical exercises and communicating results.  In class quizzes are focused on concepts from the reading, but may also be used to drive discussion. There are two larger assignments that involve R or Python programming. These may be done in groups of 1-4. Assignments will be submitted via GitHub classroom. Students will also read a scientific paper from the field of NLP and present it to the class.
